### DevReach: Hot outreach

**Inspiration**

I came up with this project after facing the same challenge as a startup founder. I havenâ€™t had the time to build it yet, but I believe itâ€™s worth exploring and can be used by hunderds of founders today, if released as open source.

**Reality**

Cold email outreach still drives most early SaaS sales. When a startup doesnâ€™t yet have brand recognition or inbound leads, the fastest way to reach potential customers is by sending direct emails to a targeted list of prospects.

Tools like [Apollo](https://www.apollo.io/) and [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/) let startups find leads and send hundreds of outreach emails, but generic messages rarely work for developer audiences.

**Problem**

Developers ignore generic outbound emails. The dev-tool market responds to context and credibility: a cold, one-size-fits-all email wonâ€™t convert. Startups need fast, scalable ways to create outreach that actually feels relevant to engineers. Parts of this idea exist in the market, but the full package (context-aware dev signals + automated pitch + outbound integration) is not covered. This gives project a strong niche.

**Solution**

Build an app that automatically personalizes outreach for developer leads by pulling public signals (GitHub, Medium, Twitter, blog posts) and composing short, relevant emails using LLMs. The app will integrate with existing outbound platforms (Apollo, HubSpot) so teams can run high-volume but highly personalized campaigns.

**Key behaviors**

- Detect public context for a lead (recent repo, blog post, and more).
- Generate a 1â€“2 sentence personalized intro + concise product pitch tied to that context.
- Produce a call-to-action with a low-friction next step (demo link, GitHub app install, repo invite).
- Push the message into your outreach tool of choice for send & tracking.

#### Example (better â€” auth key generation)

**Generic email (bad):**

> Do you find it hard to manage auth keys? Try our tool that generates keys for you in few seconds.

**Personalized email (good):**

> Hi Alex â€” I saw your repo `acme/auth-server` and your post on rotating API keys last week. I built a small service that autodetects key-usage patterns and creates short-lived auth keys + rotation hooks you can run in CI. Would you be open to a 10-minute demo and a quick repo-level test I can set up for you?

**Why this works:** references a public artifact (repo or post), states the exact pain (key rotation), and offers a concrete, low-effort next step.

#### Minimal tech plan / stack

- Data sources: GitHub API, Medium/Twitter RSS, public blogs, Crunchbase/Apollo metadata.
- Orchestration: small Python service (FastAPI) that fetches signals, formats prompt, calls an LLM (e.g., OpenAI) and returns an email draft. This includes the creation of basic agents.
- Integrations: HubSpot/Apollo API to push drafts or queued messages. Optionally a Chrome extension or GitHub App for repo-level followups.
- Safety: templates + human review step before sending.

#### Goal

Ship a minimal MVP that:

1. Fetches data for a lead from tools like Apollo.
2. Explores the web or AI tools for related content.
3. Generates a personalized 2-line intro + 1-line pitch.
4. Pushes the draft back into Apollo or HubSpot for send.

#### Optional task

- Create a dashboard using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to showcase statistics e.g. emails sent and email openned using tools like [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/).
