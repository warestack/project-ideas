### Relation with modules (BBK)

🏁 To undertake this project, you should have completed one or more of the following modules.

[Cloud computing](https://www.bbk.ac.uk/courses/modules/buci/BUCI029H7#content), [Software design and programming](https://www.bbk.ac.uk/courses/modules/coiy/COIY062H7#content), [Programming in Java](https://www.bbk.ac.uk/courses/modules/buci/BUCI033S7#content), [Software design and programming](https://www.bbk.ac.uk/courses/modules/coiy/COIY062H7#content), [Internet and web technologies](https://www.bbk.ac.uk/courses/modules/coiy/COIY063H7#content)

### Required background

*	Knowledge of programming using `Node.js` or similar frameworks.
*	Knowledge or willingness to learn building APIs using `Go`.
*	Fundamental knowledge of cloud computing and command line interfaces (Linux).
*	Understanding of REST APIs and use of `Docker`.
*	Knowledge of `GitHub` and the `GitHub cli`.

### Project idea

GitHub codespaces are a popular way of running prototype cloud applications. Each codespace is hosted by GitHub in a Docker container, running on a virtual machine.

🎯 The project aims to develop a custom microservice back-end for front-end applications or systems to interact with Codespaces in an automated way.

The core microservice back-end features include:

1. User authorization and access delegation to manage repositories on behalf of a user.

2. Initializing GitHub repositories using custom programming seeds - seeds to be provided.

3. Deploying prototype applications using custom virtual resources.

4. Manage GitHub workspaces, such as updating applications and exposing services using the microservice.

*🔍 Other features could also be identified and proposed by the student.*

### Support and resources

*	Access to the Google Cloud Platform or Amazon Web Services.
*	Programming seed repositories and other resources to start your developments.
*	Development support and advice by expert developers.

### Project learning outcomes and skills

*	You will learn how to integrate custom software with `GitHub` and build microservices.
*	You will learn how to use popular cloud platforms and deploy software on `Kubernetes`.
*	You will develop skills in REST API development using `Node.js` and `Go`.
*	You will learn how to use modern DevOps pipelines for software development.

### Difficulty level

*	**4.5/5**

>  This project includes a heavy development plan. The project implementation will be organized into features - **not all features need to be developed for this project**.
